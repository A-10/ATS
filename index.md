## How to open a ticket
If you want to open a new ticket, just type `/ticket` in the chat. (Admins have to type `ats_UserPanel` in the console). After you had entered the command the ATS user menu opens. In the choose a category and type your reason why you want to have an admin in the text box. By clicking at the bottom, you send the tickets to the admins. Now you just have to wait until an admin reads your ticket.

## How to take tickets as admin
First, you need the two permissions before you can take tickets (`ats canOpen_aMenu` and `ats aMenu_canTakeTicket`). If you not using a supported permission system you just need admin for taking tickets. If you type `/ticket` in the Chat, you open the admin menu. There you can see all of the tickets in a list. By clicking on one of the entries, you can see what the reason for the ticket is in the box on the right-hand side. By right clicking, you can take the ticket. After you had taken the ticket a new menu opens. There you can see all relevant information about your ticket. If you finished your support/ticket you can close it by clicking on "Ticket Options" --> "Resolve Ticket".
